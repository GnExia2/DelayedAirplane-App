      flight are just too great. Most of the more popular attractions in Atlanta\
      are far enough away that its going to take you some time to get there and \
      back, and youll need to allow time to get back through security and get to your gate.\

      security again to pass between any of the concourses (T, A, B, C, D, E, and F), so \
      youre not limited to the options in the concourses for your arriving and departing\
      flights. For shops/restaurants in the terminal/atrium area, however, you will have\
      to exit the secure area and re-enter, so factor time for that into your planning. \
      Between 6 am and about 9 pm, nearly all of the shops and restaurants are open. After\
      9 pm, things begin to close down for the night, and after 11 pm theres not much \
      open on the concourses (particularly C and D). Atlanta Bread Company is open 24 \
      hours in the Atrium area of the terminal (outside security). There arent, however, \
      any newsstands or other shops selling sundries after 11 pm, so if you need something \
      to read, an aspirin, a travel pillow, or a souvenir tshirt, get it before they close\
      or wait until morning.</p>')
